# Project_Advance_Calculator

Hi, if you're reading this it means you're intersted in my project! 
Thank you so much. I will give you a quick guide so you don't loose yourself to much!

Once started you will se the first manu. To chose any of the sugestion, use the numbers instead of the names! 

The scientific part is focused on ploting and calculus! There are already some predifine functions to plot so you save some time.
But if you're looking for something more specific or not already there, feel free to choose any mathematical funciton.

----------- Very important --------------------

The variable is x. So please make sure you only use x as a variable while inputing any function. 
The mathematical functions are in python version. This means e^x will throw an error, use exp(x) instead. You can alway type -help for more deatails or exit, to leave the menu you are on.

----------------------------------------------

While using the long calculation, type break or exit to stop. Don't worry, your last operation is save!


--------------- Calculus ------------------

Also make sure you use x. If the bounded integral you are trying to solve is undefine, you will receive a message saying we could not find a solution.

Try a derivative! If you input a wrong syntax, don't worry the calculator will late you know. 

We appologize, the solutions for derivative and Integrals (bounded or unbounded ) won't be saved.

------------------------------------------

If you encounter an error or an issue, feel free to write a comment or open a ticket. We will back to you as soon as possible.
